# Java Swing library
In school, we learned Object-oriented-programming in Java and created game with Java libraries (except that teachers ban Java Swing, so almost everyone used JavaFX).

Then, it was the day before my gamer friend's birthday, so I wanted to create a video to celebrate. But I wanted some randomness, which as far as I know is not easy to create in an editting video software. So I came up with the idea of using Java Swing to create some animation.
